# PathfindingAlgorithmVisualizer

Visualizations  of  algorithms  contribute  to  improving  computer  science  education. 
The  process  of  teaching  and  learning  of  algorithms  is  often  complex  and  hard  to 
understand  the  problem.  Visualization  is  a  useful  technique  for  learning  in  any 
computer  science  course.  In  this  paper,  an  e-learning  tool  for  shortest  paths 
algorithms  visualization  is  described.  The  Pathfinding  algorithms  are  important 
because they are used in applications like google maps, satellite navigation 
systems,  routing  packets  over  the  internet.  The  usage  of  pathfinding  algorithms 
isn't  just  limited  to  navigation  systems.  The  overarching  idea  can  be  applied  to 
other  applications  as  well.  As  a  beginnerâ€™s  step  to  algorithm  and  starting  to 
understand  how  they  work  I  decided  to  make  this  visualizer  that  shows  in  action 
how the pathfinding algorithm works in action. The understanding of this 
algorithm gives you the base idea of how navigation tools are implemented. In this 
visualizer, I have a grid page that has nodes that helped to pinpoint where to start 
and the endpoint. Also we can draw a line between the start node and the end node 
to  make  a  barrier  and  see  how  our  path  will  avoid  it  to  reach  the  end  node.  To 
make  this  visualizer  you  need  to  be  at  least  an  intermediate  level  in  front  end 
programming (HTML, Nodes, CSS) and a good understanding of some pathfinding 
algorithm.
